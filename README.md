# ResNet Tensorflow on CIFAR10

This is an implementation of ResNet v1 in Tensorflow.
Here, the ResNet v1 refer to the network in [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385),
where different architectures such as ResNet v2  [Identity Mappings in Deep Residual
Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.05027.pdf), wide ResNet 
[Wider or Deeper: Revisiting the ResNet Model for Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10080) is left as future work.
